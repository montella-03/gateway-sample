# Spring Cloud Gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway is a powerful and highly flexible API gateway built on top of Spring Framework. It provides a simple and consistent way to route, filter, and transform HTTP requests to microservices.

With Spring Cloud Gateway, you can easily implement cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, rate limiting, and logging. It also supports dynamic routing and can integrate with service discovery mechanisms like Netflix Eureka or HashiCorp Consul.

To get started with Spring Cloud Gateway, you can add the necessary dependencies to your project's build file and configure the routes in the application properties or YAML file.
